<div class="preparing students for the global economy">

<!-- I mean, I'm pretty sure this was a joke. What would a "preparing students for the global economy" div even look like?-->

<h1> Today we announced our Computer Science for All State Plan, dedicated to CS professional development and establishing advanced, high-quality computer science programs in New Jersey schools. </h1>

<!-- Anyway so the answer was to close the div, obviously. And have a stylesheet and make the page interesting lol. -->

<p> [Psst, I left comments in the code!] </p>
